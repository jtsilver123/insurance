#### 2. Document Management & OCR
- **AWS Textract** for OCR processing
- **Tesseract.js** as fallback OCR solution
- Automated data extraction and form pre-population
- Document versioning and audit trail

#### 3. Smart Form System
- Dynamic form generation based on coverage type
- Branching logic implementation
- Multi-input support:
  - Text input
  - Voice recording (Web Speech API)
  - Photo capture (MediaDevices API)
- Real-time validation and auto-save

#### 4. Carrier Matching & Recommendations
- NAICS code-based appetite matching
- Revenue and risk factor analysis
- Machine learning scoring for carrier fit
- Automated ACORD form generation

#### 5. Quote Comparison & AI Analysis
- Email parsing for quote extraction
- Side-by-side comparison interface
- AI-powered recommendation engine
- One-click binding with DocuSign integration

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
1. **users** - All platform users (producers and SMB clients)
2. **prospects** - Insurance prospects/submissions
3. **documents** - Uploaded documents and OCR data
4. **form_data** - Smart form submissions
5. **carriers** - Carrier information and appetite data
6. **quotes** - Carrier quotes and AI recommendations
7. **submissions** - Submission packages sent to carriers
8. **activities** - Complete activity and communication log

### Integration Tables
- **integrations** - Third-party sync status
- **email_templates** - Communication templates

## API Design

### RESTful API Structure
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with refresh tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user and per-endpoint limits
- **Validation**: Comprehensive request/response validation
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger specification

### Key Endpoints
- `/api/v1/prospects` - Prospect management
- `/api/v1/documents` - Document upload and OCR
- `/api/v1/forms` - Smart form data
- `/api/v1/carriers` - Carrier matching
- `/api/v1/quotes` - Quote management
- `/api/v1/portal` - Portal link access

## Integration Strategy

2. **Email Parsing Pipeline**
   - Regex patterns for common quote formats
   - Machine learning for unstructured quotes
   - Manual review queue for complex cases

3. **Carrier-Specific Parsers**
   - Custom parsers for major carriers
   - Template-based extraction

### AMS Integration
1. **Applied Epic API** (Phase 2)
   - Full bidirectional sync
   - Real-time policy updates
   - Automated activity logging

2. **CSV/JSON Export** (MVP)
   - Scheduled exports
   - Manual import capability

3. **Webhook Integration**
   - Real-time updates
   - Event-driven architecture
